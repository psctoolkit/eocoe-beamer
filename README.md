# Beamer theme for the EoCoE project

It is intended to provide a consistent and professional visual style for all presentations related to EoCoE.

## Features

- **Consistent design**: The theme follows the color scheme and design principles of the other EoCoE documents.
- **Customizable**: While the default design follows the EoCoE style guide, the theme can be customized to suit your specific presentation needs.

1. Clone the repository:

   Include the theme in your Beamer document by adding the following to the preamble of your LaTeX file:
   ```latex
   \usetheme{eocoe}
   ```
   You can customize the theme further by modifying the provided `beamerthemeeocoe.sty` file or adding your own settings.
